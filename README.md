- Hi, I’m @beansboii, a name I used as a place holder years ago and still stand by

- I’m currently learning python, java, and the smallest smattering of C++

- Since I'm not actually current working on anything (not that I have the skill to work on something long term anyways) I have no contact info to mention.
